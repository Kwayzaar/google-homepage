I started this project with the intention to learn positioning of content and how to alter the content to fit the spaces i needed them to. 

One aspect that took me a while to grasp was the use of flex and blocking. I'm not completely sure i have a grasp on it at this time since i seemed to have trouble with arranging items and elements 
within their respective positions. 
For instance, I had a hard time understanding how to get the footer to stay at the bottom of the page and then present everything inline. I wanted to use display:flex and then lay everything out in a row but for some reason i could not get the ul elements to sit at the bottom of the page, as it kept attaching itself to the bottom of the form buttons in the middle of the page 
Eventually i just had to float the left and right footer items and display them inline, and adjust margins as necessary to create the look of the G homepage

One thing that i did after a continuously getting lost was add a border outline to all the elements and child elements on the page so that i could visualize how the blocks were laid out and what space it was taking, and what the items inside the block were doing
This helped tremendously with understanding which positioning properties i wanted to add to the elements and once i did that a lot of things began to click. I imagine I will use this strategy for a while

Still have a lot to learn
